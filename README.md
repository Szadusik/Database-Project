# Database-Project
# Local Registration Database

A MySQL database project created as of a private contract and a tool for getting experience with databases.    

# About

The main goal of the database is to support the management of registrations locally in the city. It is also a good tool for learning the basics of how MySQL databases work and their basic functionalities.

Database tracks the history of all check-ins which took place, registered buildings with premises inside them and also inhabitants registered in property described by the registration.

# Database scheme

The first step of the project was to create an entity relationship schema as to see which entities do we need, what attributes does every entity needs and how they should be connected with each other. The final ER diagram looks like this.
